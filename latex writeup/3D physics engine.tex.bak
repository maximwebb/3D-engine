\begin{abstract}
This report will describe the process of building a 3-D physics engine, with the end goal being to create an accurate model for projectile motion.
\newline
\newline
However, this is not the sole goal; the aim throughout the project is to build a physics engine from first principles, without relying on pre-existing 3-D graphical APIs such as OpenGL, or Direct3D. Therefore, the report will also describe the mathematics behind the rendering process, as well as the necessary methods for representing 3-D transformations.

\section{Technology}
The program will be written in C++, for its speed, and for its object orientation, which will prove useful for the structure of the project. This includes the use of several template classes from the STL, such as \verb|<cmath>| and \verb|<vector>|.
\newline
\newline
Windows GDI will be used for basic graphical output, which is limited to drawing lines and polygons. 
\newline
\newline
Git will be used for this project, providing versatile and powerful VCS. The project's source code is available 
\href{https://github.com/maximwebb/3D-engine}{\color{blue} on Github}\color{black}.

\newpage
\section{Basic Structure}

First, the Point class will be the building blocks of engine, with the parameter \verb|abs_pos| describing the absolute position in the universe. The method \verb|update()| will be fleshed out later.
\begin{lstlisting}
class Point {
public:
	/* Parameters */
	vector<float> abs_pos;
	
	void update() {
	
	}

}
\end{lstlisting}

Next, the Plane class stores an array of points, and contains a method for updating them iteratively. 
\begin{lstlisting}
class Plane {
public:
	/* Parameters */
	vector<Point> points;
	
	void update_points() {
		for (int p = 0; p < points.size(); p++) {
			points[p].update();
		}
	}
	
}
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage
The Obloid class is the umbrella class for all 3-D objects in the program. Obloids will take four points as parameters, and generate the remaining four vertices. From this, six planes (faces) can be constructed, and stored in an array. 
\newline
\newline
Obloids will also store physical attributes, such as mass and velocity, which will be added later.

\begin{lstlisting}
class Obloid {
public:

	/* Parameters: Top-Right-Front, Top-Right-Back, Bottom-Left-Back, Bottom-Left-Front */
	Point trf{ { 0, 0, 0, 1 } };
	Point trb{ { 0, 0, 0, 1 } };
	Point blb{ { 0, 0, 0, 1 } };
	Point blf{ { 0, 0, 0, 1 } };
	
	/* Generate remaining four vertices */
	Point brf{ { blb.abs_pos[0], trf.abs_pos[1], trf.abs_pos[2], 1 } };
	Point brb{ { blb.abs_pos[0], trf.abs_pos[1], blb.abs_pos[2], 1 } };
	Point tlf{ { trf.abs_pos[0], blb.abs_pos[1], trf.abs_pos[2], 1 } };
	Point tlb{ { trf.abs_pos[0], blb.abs_pos[1], blb.abs_pos[2], 1 } };
	
	/* Generate six planes */	
	Plane pl_top{ { trf, trb, tlb, tlf } };
	Plane pl_bottom{ { brf, brb, blb, blf } };
	Plane pl_left{ { tlf, tlb, blb, blf } };
	Plane pl_right{ { trf, brf, brb, trb } };
	Plane pl_front{ { trf, tlf, blf, brf } };
	Plane pl_back{ { trb, tlb, blb, brb } };
	
	vector<Plane> faces = { pl_left, pl_right, pl_bottom, pl_top, pl_back, pl_front };
	
	void update_faces(HDC hdc) {
		for (int f = 0; f < faces.size(); f++) {
			faces[f].update_points();
		}
	}
}
\end{lstlisting}

\newpage

The \verb|PLAYER| class will store global information about the viewer, including the viewer's position, velocity, field of view, and various other properties:

\begin{lstlisting}
class PLAYER {
public:

	/* Stores player's absolute universal coordinates from origin. */
	vector<int> coords = { 0, 0, 0 };

	float fov = 120;	
	
	int xVel;
	int yVel;
	int zVel;

};

PLAYER Player;
\end{lstlisting}

These four classes make up the fundamental structure of the program, and they will all be added to shortly.

\newpage
\section{Projecting onto the viewport}
When considering displaying objects on the viewport (the visible section of the screen), it becomes evident that a method is required for converting between the 3-D coordinates of the universe, and the 2-D coordinates of the viewport. This process must account for depth, thereby providing perspective.

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{projection_diagram.png}

The diagram shows a bird's eye view of the viewer's vision. The green dot represents a point in the viewer's line of sight, and is a certain z-distance away from the viewer. At this z-distance, there is a virtual plane to project the point onto, represented by the pink line. 
\newline
\newline
Then, the width of the virtual plane, and the ratio of this width to the point's displacement from the centre line is found as follows:
\newline
\newline
Let p = plane width, let x, z be coordinates of point:
$$ p = ztan{\theta} $$
$$ ratio = \frac{x}{ztan{\theta}} $$
Applying the same logic, the vertical ratio is $ \frac{y}{ztan{\theta}} $
\newline
\newline
Then, if the screen has width w and height h, the coordinates on the window $(s_x, s_y) $ are as follows:

$$ s_x = \frac{1}{2}w + \frac{xw}{ztan{\theta}} $$
$$ s_y = \frac{1}{2}h + \frac{yh}{ztan{\theta}} $$
\newpage
It is worth noting at this point that this method only works if the viewer is centred about (0, 0, 0). Therefore, in the Point class definition, there should be a second position coordinate, relative to the viewer. With this new type of coordinate, \verb|update()| can now be defined as shown:

\begin{lstlisting}
class Point {
public:
	/* Parameters */
	vector<float> abs_pos;
	
	vector<float> rel_pos;
	int screen_x;
	int screen_y;	
	
	void update() {
		screen_x = window_width * 0.5 + window_width * rel_pos[0] / (rel_pos[2] * tan(fov));

		screen_y = window_height * 0.5 + window_width * rel_pos[1] / (rel_pos[2] * tan(fov));
	}
	
	void draw(HDC hdc) {
	
	}
}

\end{lstlisting}
For clarity's sake, some of the variables have been renamed in the code, but the function is the same as the previous result.

\newpage

\section{Transformations of 3-D space}
Now that projections onto the viewport has been implemented, there needs to be a way of the viewer moving around the universe. This requires translating and rotating the universe about the viewer.
\newline
\newline
There are several methods for handling these transformations - one approach would be the use of quaternions, which are an extension of complex numbers, consisting of four separate parts to handle rotations. For this project, however, matrices will handle all transformations, predominantly for their versatility and speed for manipulating vector space.
\newline
\newline
The first problem to tackle is creating a matrix data type - C++ does not natively support matrices, so they will need to be built in manually. By using a typedef to define a \verb|matrix| data type as a nested array of floats:

\begin{lstlisting}
using matrix = vector<vector<float>>;
\end{lstlisting}

A function can be created that will taken an array of 16 numbers and return a 4x4 matrix:
\begin{lstlisting}
matrix Mat(vector<float> arr) {
	matrix mat;

	for (int row = 0; row < 4; row++) {
		mat.push_back({});
		for (int col = 0; col < 4; col++) {
			mat[row].push_back(arr[row * 4 + col]);
		}
	}
	return mat;
}
\end{lstlisting}

While this approach may seem more convoluted than simply defining a matrix class, it allows for direct interaction with the elements inside the matrix, and is more lightweight than a class or struct.
\newline
\newline
Next, by defining matrix multiplication, it is possible to chain transformations and apply transformations to vectors. Here, the \verb|multiply()| function is overloaded so that multiplication between two matrices and multiplication between a matrix and a vector is separate. While this could be combined into a single function, it would require conversion of position vectors (currently 1-D arrays) into matrices (2-D arrays) each cycle, a computationally expensive process.

\begin{lstlisting}

/* Multiplies two matrices and returns the resulting matrix */
matrix multiply(matrix mat1, matrix mat2) {
	matrix mat3;
	for (int row = 0; row < 4; row++) {
		mat3.push_back({});
		for (int num = 0; num < 4; num++) {
			mat3[row].push_back(0);
			for (int col = 0; col < 4; col++) {
				mat3[row][num] += (mat1[row][col] * mat2[col][num]);
			}
		}
	}

	return mat3;
}

/* Multiplies a vector by a matrix and returns the resulting vector */
vector<int> multiply(matrix transform_mat, vector<int> pt) {
	vector<int> pt2;
	for (int row = 0; row < 4; row++) {
		pt2.push_back(0);
		for (int col = 0; col < 4; col++) {
			pt2[row] += (pt[col] * transform_mat[row][col]);
		}
	}

	return pt2;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage

You may have noticed that all of the vectors and matrices defined thus far have been four dimensional, whereas the universe has only three spatial dimensions. The reasoning behind this is that whilst 3 x 3 matrices can be used to represent linear transformations, they cannot represent a translation, without defining an addition function.
\newline
\newline
Instead, by using four rows and columns, the (x, y, z) offset can be represented in the fourth column as shown:

$$
M = 
\begin{pmatrix}
	1 & 0 & 0 & x \\
	0 & 1 & 0 & y \\
	0 & 0 & 1 & z \\
	0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	
\end {pmatrix}
$$

By storing the (x, y, z) offset as such, translations are kept separate of rotations, simplifying the process greatly. Translations are now defined by adding the player velocity vector to these entries in the matrix.
\newline
\newline
The rotation matrices can now be defined. For rotations about the y-axis:

$$ R_y = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos{\theta} & 0 & \sin{\theta} & 0 \\
		0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\
		-\sin{\theta} & 0 & \cos{\theta} & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
$$
The matrix for rotations about the x-axis:
$$ R_x = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		0 & \cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} & 0 \\
		0 & \sin{\theta} & \cos{\theta} & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
$$
And for the sake of completeness, rotations about the z-axis (this one will not be used, as it does not result in a particularly useful transformation).
$$
R_z = 
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos{\theta} & -\sin{\theta} & 0 & 0 \\
		\sin{\theta} & cos{\theta} & 0 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\
		0 & 0 & 0 & 1
	\end{pmatrix}
$$

\newpage
The \verb|pos| property for the Player class will be the matrix describing the current linear transformation of vector space: 

\begin{lstlisting}
class PLAYER {
public:

	/*Stores player's absolute universal coordinates from origin.*/
	vector<int> coords = { 0, 0, 0 };

	float fov = 120;	
	
	int xVel;
	int yVel;
	int zVel;
	
	matrix pos = Mat({ {1, 0, 0, 0,
					0, 1, 0, 0,
					0, 0, 1, 0,
					0, 0, 0, 1} });

};
\end{lstlisting}

These are all the necessary methods required to transform 3-D space, allowing the viewer to move and look around freely. In the next section, the necessary methods for updating and drawing the universe are detailed.
\newpage

\section{Updating and Drawing in the Event Loop}

Now that all of the fundamental groundwork is in place, there needs to be a graphical output. This is done by adding the following code to the plane class, meaning the quadrilateral defined by the plane's vertices will be filled in:

\begin{lstlisting}

class Plane {
public:
	/* Parameters */
	vector<Point> points;
	
	/* Other */
	POINT arr[4];
	
	void update_points() {
		for (int p = 0; p < points.size(); p++) {
			points[p].update();
			
			arr[i].x = points[i].screen_x;
			arr[i].y = points[i].screen_y;
		}
	}
	
	void fill_plane(HDC hdc) {	
		SelectObject(hdc, GetStockObject(DC_BRUSH));
		SetDCBrushColor(hdc, RGB(200, 35, 16));
		Polygon(hdc, points, 4);
	}
	
}
\end{lstlisting}

Note: \verb|arr| is a C-style array, used because the \verb|Polygon()| method requires a static array. Some code has been excluded from this section, but it is predominantly used for configuring Windows GDI, and is not relevant to the project.
\newpage
Adding \verb|fill_plane()| to the Obloid class's update loop, and defining a new Obloid, means that objects can now be drawn:

\includegraphics[width=1\textwidth]{first_cube.png}

Success! Next, in order to move and look around in the universe, an event loop is required. This will continuously update and draw all the objects in the universe:

\begin{lstlisting}

void clear(HDC hdc, RECT* prc) {
	HBRUSH brush_white = CreateSolidBrush(RGB(255, 255, 255));
	FillRect(hdc, prc, brush_white);
	DeleteObject(brush_white);
}

int timer = SetTimer(hWnd, MYTIMER, 5, NULL);

LRESULT CALLBACK WndProc(HWND hWnd, UINT message, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
	//Above code hidden
	
	case WM_TIMER:
	{
	
		/* Checks for keyboard input & adjusts velocity */
		if (GetAsyncKeyState('A') < 0) {
			player.xVel = -5;
		}
		else if (GetAsyncKeyState('D') < 0) {
			player.xVel = 5;
		}
		
		else {
			player.xVel = 0;
		}

		if (GetAsyncKeyState('W') < 0) {
			player.zVel = 5;
		}
		else if (GetAsyncKeyState('S') < 0) {
			player.zVel = -5;
		}
		else {
			player.zVel = 0;
		}

		if (GetAsyncKeyState(0x20) < 0) {
			player.yVel = 5;
		}
		else if (GetAsyncKeyState(0xA0) < 0) {
			player.yVel = -5;
		}
		else {
			player.yVel = 0;
		}
		
		/* Updates viewer pos matrix */
		player.pos[0][3] += player.xVel;
		player.pos[1][3] += player.yVel;
		player.pos[2][3] += player.zVel;
		
		clear(hdc, &window_rect);
		cube_1.update_faces(hdc);
		
\end{lstlisting}
Then, adding the rotation matrices from the previous section, the viewer can now freely look around the universe:

\begin{lstlisting}
	/* Keyboard input for rotations */
	if (GetAsyncKeyState(0x25) < 0) {
		player.xAng = player.angVel;
		player.masterAng += player.angVel;
	}
	else if (GetAsyncKeyState(0x27) < 0) {
		player.xAng = -player.angVel;
		player.masterAng -= player.angVel;
	}

	else {
		player.xAng = 0;
	}
	if (GetAsyncKeyState(0x26) < 0) {
		player.yAng = player.angVel;
	}
	else if (GetAsyncKeyState(0x28) < 0) {
		player.yAng = -player.angVel;
	}

	else {
		player.yAng = 0;
	}

	matrix rotXMat = Mat({ { cos(player.xAng), 0, sin(player.xAng), 0,
		0, 1, 0, 0,
		-sin(player.xAng), 0, cos(player.xAng), 0,
		0, 0, 0, 1
		} });

	matrix rotYMat = Mat({ { 1, 0, 0, 0,
		0, cos(player.yAng), sin(player.yAng), 0,
		0, -sin(player.yAng), cos(player.xAng), 0,
		0, 0, 0, 1
		} });

	player.pos = multiply(rotXMat, player.pos);
	player.pos = multiply(rotYMat, player.pos);
\end{lstlisting}
\end{document}
